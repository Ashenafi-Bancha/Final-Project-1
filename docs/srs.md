# 2.2. Current System
## 2.2.1. Major Function of the Current System
Currently, fundraising activities in Ethiopia are conducted through informal, decentralized, and largely unstructured methods. Individuals and communities seeking financial support for life events, such as medical emergencies, educational expenses, funerals, and community development projects primarily rely on personal networks rather than dedicated digital platforms.

Fundraising is deeply embedded in Ethiopia’s strong community culture and is commonly carried out through social media appeals, in-person collections, and direct financial transfers. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Telegram are widely used to share fundraising stories and mobilize support from friends, family members, and the Ethiopian diaspora. In addition, community gatherings, religious institutions, and family networks facilitate face-to-face cash collections. Financial contributions are also made through direct bank transfers and mobile money services.

-Absence of verification mechanisms for fundraising campaigns
-High risk of fraud and misuse of funds
-Limited transparency and accountability

-Limited reach to donors beyond immediate social networks
