# Final Year Project Proposal

## Project Title

**CommunityConnect: A Life-Oriented Crowdfunding Platform (GoFundMe-like System) for Ethiopia**

---

## 1. Background

In Ethiopia, individuals facing life challenges such as medical emergencies, education expenses, funeral costs, and sudden personal crises often depend on informal fundraising mechanisms. These mechanisms typically involve social media posts, personal bank transfers, or word-of-mouth communication. While these approaches reflect the country’s strong culture of community support, they suffer from significant limitations, including lack of transparency, limited reach, weak verification mechanisms, and low donor trust.

International crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe provide structured solutions for personal fundraising; however, they are not fully accessible or localized for Ethiopian users due to contextual, technical, and payment-related constraints. As a result, there is a growing need for a localized, simple, and trustworthy digital crowdfunding platform that focuses on individual life-based fundraising within the Ethiopian context.

CommunityConnect is proposed as a web-based, GoFundMe-like crowdfunding platform that enables individuals to create verified fundraising campaigns for personal life events while allowing donors to contribute securely and transparently.

## 2. Statement of the Problem

Despite the willingness of communities to support individuals in need, personal fundraising in Ethiopia faces several challenges:

- Individuals lack a centralized and trusted digital platform to raise funds for life-related emergencies.
- Donors often hesitate to contribute due to the absence of verification and transparency in fundraising campaigns.
- Fundraising conducted through social media lacks accountability, progress tracking, and structured reporting.
- There is no effective system to monitor donations, campaign updates, and fund usage in one place.

These challenges reduce donor confidence, limit outreach—especially to the diaspora—and delay timely support for individuals experiencing urgent life events.

### 3.2 Specific Objectives

- To allow individuals or community members to create fundraising campaigns for life-related events such as medical emergencies, education support, funerals, accidents, and disasters.
- To enable donors to contribute securely to verified campaigns.
- To implement an administrative campaign verification and approval mechanism.
- To provide transparent donation tracking and progress visualization.
- To support anonymous and public donations based on donor preference.
- To allow fundraisers to post campaign updates for accountability.

## 4. Scope of the Project

### 4.1 Scope

The CommunityConnect system focuses on individual- and community-based, life-oriented crowdfunding. The platform will include core functionalities such as user registration using phone numbers, campaign creation and categorization by life events, admin-based campaign verification, donation processing (real or simulated), donation progress visualization, anonymous donation options, campaign updates, and administrative monitoring.

The system will be developed as a web-based application and deployed in a controlled academic environment. Payment gateway integration may be simulated or limited for demonstration purposes.

### 4.2 Limitations

- The system does not include full banking settlement or financial licensing.
- Mobile applications are outside the scope of this project.
- Advanced fraud detection mechanisms are not implemented.
- Internet accessibility limitations may affect real-world deployment.
