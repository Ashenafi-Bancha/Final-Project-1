# Final Year Project Proposal

## Project Title

**CommunityConnect: A Donation Platform for Ethiopia That Bridges Donors and Communities**

---

## Abstract

CommunityConnect is a web-based, life-oriented donation and crowdfunding platform designed to address the challenges of informal fundraising practices in Ethiopia. Currently, individuals and communities rely heavily on social media, personal networks, and manual bank transfers to raise funds for medical emergencies, education expenses, funerals, disasters, and community projects. These methods lack transparency, accountability, and proper verification, leading to mistrust and limited donor participation, especially from the Ethiopian diaspora.
CommunityConnect aims to provide a secure, transparent, and localized digital platform that enables individuals and communities to create verified fundraising campaigns while allowing donors to contribute confidently. The system incorporates admin-based campaign verification, donation progress tracking, community support reporting, and culturally relevant features such as anonymous donations and phone number–based registration. This project is proposed as a Final Year Project and serves as a scalable foundation for a real-world Ethiopian donation platform.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background Study

Ethiopia has a strong tradition of community support and collective responsibility, where individuals assist one another during challenging life events such as medical emergencies, education expenses, funerals, and natural disasters. This culture is further strengthened by the contribution of the Ethiopian diaspora, which plays an important role in supporting families and community initiatives financially.

Despite this strong social support system, fundraising activities remain largely informal and fragmented. Individuals commonly rely on social media posts, word-of-mouth communication, and manual bank transfers to raise funds. These methods lack proper verification, transparency, tracking, and accountability mechanisms, which reduces donor trust and limits their effectiveness.

With the increasing adoption of digital technologies and internet services in Ethiopia, there is an opportunity to transform traditional fundraising into a more structured and reliable digital process. Although international crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe offer structured solutions, they are not fully accessible or localized for Ethiopian users due to contextual and payment-related constraints.

To address these challenges, CommunityConnect is proposed as a web-based, localized crowdfunding platform that enables individuals to create verified fundraising campaigns for personal life events and community needs. The platform aims to provide a secure, transparent, and trustworthy environment for donors while strengthening community support through technology.

### 1.2 Reason to Study

The need to study and develop CommunityConnect arises from the absence of a centralized, reliable, and locally tailored digital donation platform within the Ethiopian context. Although international crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe provide structured fundraising solutions, they are not fully accessible to Ethiopian users due to payment integration challenges, regulatory constraints, limited localization, and contextual differences. As a result, many individuals and communities are unable to benefit from existing global crowdfunding technologies.
Studying this problem is essential to understand how modern web-based fundraising systems can be adapted to align with Ethiopia’s social, cultural, and technological environment. By addressing issues of transparency, verification, and accountability, this study seeks to design a system that enhances donor trust and improves the overall effectiveness of donation-based fundraising. Furthermore, the study contributes to exploring how digital platforms can strengthen community support mechanisms and promote more organized and credible fundraising practices in Ethiopia.

### 1.3. Motivation

The motivation for this project stems from real-life observations of individuals and communities facing significant challenges in raising funds during critical life events, such as medical emergencies, education-related expenses, and funeral costs. Despite the presence of genuine and urgent needs, many fundraising efforts fail to receive adequate support due to donor mistrust, lack of transparency, and the absence of reliable verification mechanisms in existing informal fundraising practices.
Furthermore, this project is motivated by the aspiration to contribute to Ethiopia’s ongoing digital transformation by applying modern web technologies to address pressing social challenges. Developing CommunityConnect as a Final Year Project provides an opportunity to build a socially impactful and locally relevant system that strengthens community support, promotes transparency, and delivers meaningful benefits to individuals and communities across Ethiopia.

## 2. Statement of the Problem

Despite the willingness of communities to support individuals in need, personal fundraising in Ethiopia faces several challenges:

- Individuals lack a centralized and trusted digital platform to raise funds for life-related emergencies.
- Donors often hesitate to contribute due to the absence of verification and transparency in fundraising campaigns.
- Fundraising conducted through social media lacks accountability, progress tracking, and structured reporting.
- There is no effective system to monitor donations, campaign updates, and fund usage in one place.

These challenges reduce donor confidence, limit outreach—especially to the diaspora—and delay timely support for individuals experiencing urgent life events.

## 3. Objectives of the Project

### 3.1 General Objective

To design and develop a web-based, life-oriented crowdfunding platform that enables individuals and communities in Ethiopia to raise funds for personal and urgent life-related needs in a secure, transparent, and verifiable manner.

### 3.2 Specific Objectives

- To allow individuals or community members to create fundraising campaigns for life-related events such as medical emergencies, education support, funerals, accidents, and disasters.
- To enable donors to contribute securely to verified campaigns.
- To implement an administrative campaign verification and approval mechanism.
- To provide transparent donation tracking and progress visualization.
- To support anonymous and public donations based on donor preference.
- To allow fundraisers to post campaign updates for accountability.
- To introduce a **Community Support Reporting** feature that allows users to report urgent community or individual life challenges which can be converted into fundraising campaigns.
- To design an administrative dashboard for monitoring users, campaigns, community support reports, and donations.

## 4. Scope of the Project

### 4.1 Scope

The CommunityConnect system focuses on individual- and community-based, life-oriented crowdfunding. The platform will include core functionalities such as user registration using phone numbers, campaign creation and categorization by life events, admin-based campaign verification, donation processing (real or simulated), donation progress visualization, anonymous donation options, campaign updates, and administrative monitoring.

The system will be developed as a web-based application and deployed in a controlled academic environment. Payment gateway integration may be simulated or limited for demonstration purposes.

### 4.2 Limitations

- The system does not include full banking settlement or financial licensing.
- Mobile applications are outside the scope of this project.
- Advanced fraud detection mechanisms are not implemented.
- Internet accessibility limitations may affect real-world deployment.
