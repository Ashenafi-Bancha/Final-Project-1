# CommunityConnect 🤝  
### A Life-Oriented Crowdfunding Platform (GoFundMe-like System) for Ethiopia

CommunityConnect is a web-based, life-oriented crowdfunding platform designed to help individuals and communities in Ethiopia raise funds for urgent life-related needs such as medical emergencies, education support, funerals, accidents, and disasters.  
The system focuses on **transparency, trust, and simplicity**, inspired by platforms like GoFundMe but tailored to the Ethiopian context.

## 📌 Project Overview

In Ethiopia, fundraising for personal and community emergencies is often done through informal channels such as social media and word-of-mouth. These methods lack verification, transparency, and proper tracking, which reduces donor trust and limits outreach.

**CommunityConnect** addresses this gap by providing:
- Verified fundraising campaigns
- Transparent donation tracking
- Community-driven support reporting
- Admin-based oversight for trust and accountability
